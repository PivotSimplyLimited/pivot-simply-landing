That experience awakened her empathy and sensitivity from a young age — a gift she didn't yet know how to harness. Throughout her life, people — friends, parents from her child's school, even strangers — would open up to her, sharing their pain, as if drawn to her healing energy."

      {
        "content": "She invested in her first coaching program, only to discover that the environment itself mirrored her old energy patterns. The group that was meant to empower her turned into another space of conflict — a woman constantly created trouble, and despite reporting the issue, the coach offered little support."
      },
      {
        "content": "In her local mum's circle, similar patterns appeared — a culture of judgment and mockery. Women mocked others' dressing sense, choices, and parenting styles. When Mithlesh tried to distance herself, she became a target of gossip and bullying."
